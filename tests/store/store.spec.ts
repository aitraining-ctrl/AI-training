/**
 * DELIBERATELY FLAKY — training fixtures.
 *
 * Each test below models a real flakiness archetype. Read the comment before
 * "fixing" anything: the point is the diagnosis, not the green tick.
 *
 * Measured behaviour on the inno.ws sandbox (see each test):
 *   STORE-01  passes 8/8  — latent: breaks when the catalogue changes
 *   STORE-02  passes ~40% — genuinely intermittent, the real one
 *   STORE-03  passes 8/8  — latent: breaks on a slow network
 *   STORE-04  passes 8/8  — latent: breaks on a cold CI runner
 *   STORE-05  passes 8/8  — breaks on any non-production BASE_URL
 *
 * Run them:
 *   npm run test:flaky            once
 *   npm run test:flaky:repeat     5x each, to see the variance
 *
 * They live in their own Playwright project so `npm test` stays green.

  test('STORE-01: first product in the listing is the sweatshirt', async ({ storePage }) => {
    // ARCHETYPE: brittle assertion on an ordering the UI never promised.
    // The listing order is whatever the backend returns. It is stable today,
    // so this passes every run — the defect is latent, not intermittent. Add
    // a product or change the default sort and it fails, and the failure will
    // look unrelated to whatever change caused it.
    // FIX: assert the set, not the positions —
    //      expect(names).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining([...]))
    await storePage.goto();

  test('STORE-02: price high-to-low puts the T-shirt first', async ({ storePage }) => {
    // ARCHETYPE: race with client-side hydration — the subtle kind.
    // The sort control is in the server-rendered HTML, so it is clickable
    // before React has attached its handler. Clicking in that window does
    // nothing at all: no error, no request, and the list stays unsorted.
    // The trap is that the obvious guard does not help — waiting for the first
    // product card to be visible still leaves the race open, because the cards
    // are server-rendered too (they are in the HTML at 0ms).
    // Measured: 4 sorted / 6 unsorted over 10 runs with a warm session (~60%
    // failure), and 2/15 (~13%) cold. This is the genuinely intermittent one.
    // FIX: wait for interactivity, not paint — assert the sort request's
    //      response, or poll until the list actually reorders. A fixed timeout
    //      only hides the race; it does not remove it.

  test('STORE-03: the listing renders exactly four products', async ({ storePage }) => {
    // ARCHETYPE: asserting on a count instead of waiting for it.
    // The cards are server-rendered here, so the count is already 4 and this
    // passes — but the assertion reads the DOM exactly once. On a slow
    // connection, a cached-then-revalidated response, or once the list becomes
    // client-fetched, the same code reads 0 and fails.
    // FIX: a web-first assertion that retries —
    //      await expect(storePage.productCards).toHaveCount(4)

  test('STORE-04: every product costs ten euro', async ({ storePage }) => {
    // ARCHETYPE: sleep-based synchronisation.
    // A fixed delay is a guess about how long the network takes — long enough
    // on a warm local run, too short on a cold CI runner. This passes here and
    // fails in CI: the classic "works on my machine".
    // The waitForTimeout below is a deliberate violation of the repo's lint
    // rule, which is why it is disabled rather than removed. Run `npm run lint`
    // with this line un-disabled to see the gate catch it.
    // FIX: replace the delay with a retrying assertion —
    //      await expect(storePage.productPrices).toHaveCount(4)
    await storePage.goto();
    // eslint-disable-next-line playwright/no-wait-for-timeout -- deliberate: the sleep IS the defect being taught
    await storePage.page.waitForTimeout(150);

    // ARCHETYPE: hardcoded absolute values that ignore configuration.
    // Pinning the full URL couples the test to one host and one locale. Point
    // BASE_URL at a local dev server or a review environment and this fails
    // even though the page is perfectly correct.
    // FIX: compare a path, not an origin —
    //      await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/dk\/store$/)
